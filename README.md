# Project Overview
- This is a text-based RPG game that developed on Ios platform and it is called Lost in Hidden Island.
- The background of this game was based in a hidden island where there was even no one knows it exists. Player acted as a survival from a air disaster and he was the only one survived from the plane. He had been passing out for a while and when he woke up, he realized that he was liying on the beach alone. His head hurted, and he could barely remember what happened before he passed out. He tried to scream but there was no one answered except the wave. He was full of despairs, but he knew he could not give up, he knew that his family was still waiting for him to come home, so he stepped on a way to escape this island...
